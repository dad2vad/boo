If you want to contribute to improving the library, use the following instructions to create changes:

> **Note:** we prefer English language for all communication.

## Creating an issue

If you found a bug or want to make an improvement in the library please check whether the same issue already exists in the [list of issues](https://github.com/artalar/reatom/issues). If you don't find the issue there, [create a new one](https://github.com/artalar/reatom/issues/new) including a description of the problem.

## Sending a Pull Request

1. 🐙 Fork and clone the repository.
2. 🗜️ Install dependencies from the root of the repo, `node@18` and `npm@8` required.
   ```bash
   npm i
   ```
   All needed dependencies for all packages will be installed automatically, but only `@reatom/framework` dependencies (`core`, `utils`, `async` and a few more) will be builded.
3. 🔨 Build needed package from the root of the repo.
   ```bash
   npx turbo run build --filter=PACKAGE_NAME
   ```
   Replace `PACKAGE_NAME` with the name of the package you want to build. For example, `npm-react` or `persist`. The [turbo](https://turbo.build) will handle all dependencies and build all required graph.
4. 🎨 Create a `feature-branch` from `v3` branch that starts from the number of the [created issue](#creating-an-issue).
5. 🧪 If you want to fix a bug, write reproduction tests first.
6. 🪄 Make changes.
7. 🧪 If you added a feature, write tests for it.
8. 📝 Record the changes according to [conventional rules](#commit-rules).
   ```bash
   $ git commit -m "<type>[optional scope]: <description>"
   ```
9. 💍 Send the changes to GitHub and create [Pull Request](https://github.com/artalar/reatom/compare) to the `v3` branch.
10. 🔗 Link the Pull Request and issue with [keyword](https://help.github.com/en/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords) or provide description with motivation and explanation in the comment. Example: `fix #74`.
11. ⏳ Wait for a decision about accepting the changes.

## Create a new package

We want to grow a huge ecosystem of packages for Reatom and made an adapters for most popular web APIs and NPM libraries. If you want to help with it, please follow the instructions of [Sending a Pull Request](#sending-a-pull-request) section, but on the third step you should add a new package to the `packages` directory We have a handy generator for it, run the following command from the root of the repo and follow the displayed instructions.

```bash
npm run package-generator
```

Edit the `author` field and add yourself to the `maintainers` list of the `package.json` of the new package.

If you need to add dependencies, add them manually to the `package.json` of the new package and install them from the root of the repo.

## Codestyle rules

1. use `// @ts-ignore` if you not sure why error appears or you think it could be better, use `// @ts-expect-error` if you sure that error is a mistake.

## Commit rules

Record the changes made by making comments in accordance with [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org).
