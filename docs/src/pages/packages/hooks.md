> included in [@reatom/framework](/packages/framework)

All atoms and actions have a hooks to they lifecycle, this package expose friendly helpers to use this hooks.

As all computations in Reatom are lazy, it is safe to create atoms or actions dynamically in fabrics, for [atomization](/guides/atomization) for example. You could use this hooks for dynamic atoms too if the target atom is dynamic. If the target atom is static (in global scope) and you create a hook dynamically in some fabric you should manage the hook dispose manually, by the returned callback.

A lot of cool examples you could find in [async package docs](/packages/async).

## `withInit`

Operator to set state creator callback to an atom, which is called by first atom subscription (during transaction).

```ts
import { atom } from "@reatom/core";
import { withInit } from "@reatom/hooks";

const dateAtom = atom(0).pipe(withInit(() => Date.now()));
```

## `onConnect`

Subscribe to atom subscription, optionally return cleanup callback (called during effect queue).

Passed `ctx` have `isConnected` method which checks the passed atom current status.

```ts
import { onConnect } from "@reatom/hooks";

const dispose = onConnect(messagesAtom, (ctx) => {
  const cb = (message) => {
    messagesAtom(ctx, (messages) => [...messages, message]);
  };

  WS.on("message", cb);

  return () => WS.off("message", cb);
});
```

## `onDisconnect`

Shortcut to `onConnect` return callback.

## `onUpdate`

Derive atom or action update during transaction.

```ts
import { onUpdate } from "@reatom/hooks";

const dispose = onUpdate(pagingAtom, (ctx, page) => fetchData(ctx, page));
```

For computed atoms it is called only when the atom is connected.

<!-- Very simplified example of lazy analytics connection.

```ts
// analytics.ts
import { isAtom } from '@reatom/core'
import { onUpdate } from '@reatom/hooks'
import * as moduleA from '~/module-a'
// ...
import * as moduleN from '~/module-N'

for (const mod of [moduleA, moduleN]) {
  for (const name of Object.keys(mod)) {
    if (isAtom(mod[name])) {
      onUpdate(mod[name], (ctx, data) => analyticsService.send(name, data))
    }
  }
}
``` -->

## `spyChange`

Spy an atom or an action change in the atom reducer. The difference with [onUpdate](#onupdate) is that `spyChange` is a warm link - works inside atom only when it have a connections.

`spyChange(CtxSpy, anAtom, (value) => any): isChanged`

```ts
import { atom } from "@reatom/core";
import { spyChange } from "@reatom/hooks";

export const someAtom = atom((ctx, state = initState) => {
  spyChange(ctx, someAction, (payload) => {
    state = state + payload;
  });
  // OR
  if (spyChange(ctx, someAction)) {
    state = state + payload;
  }
});
```

<!-- ## `isConnected` -->
