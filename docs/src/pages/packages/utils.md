description: Reatom for utils

This is a super tiny package which includes a set of well-typed simple utils: `noop`, `sleep`, `isObject`, `isShallowEqual`, `isDeepEqual`, `assign`, `pick`, `omit`, `jsonClone`, `random`.

A lot of edge cases are missing here, but this is a necessary start for any TypeScript project.
