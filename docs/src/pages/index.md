description: Reatom - tiny and powerful reactive system with immutable nature
---

Reatom is the ultimate [state manager](/general/what-is-state-manager) with quite unique set of features, it provides the most modern techniques for describing, executing, and debugging code in a tiny package. It opinionated data manager with strict, but flexible rules, which allows you to write simple and maintainable code.

Key principles are **immutability** and **explicit reactivity** (no proxies), implicit **DI** and actor-like **lifecycle hooks**. All this with simple API and **automatic type inference**.

[The core package](/core) is included all this features and you may use it anywhere, from huge apps to even small libs, as the overhead only [2 KB](https://bundlejs.com/?q=%40reatom%2Fcore). Also, you could reuse our carefully written [helper tools](/packages/framework) to solve complex tasks in a couple lines of code. We trying to build stable and balanced ecosystem for perfect DX and predictable maintains even for years ahead.

## Simple example

[vanilla repl](https://codesandbox.io/s/reatom-first-example-6oo36v?file=/src/index.ts)

[react repl](https://replit.com/@artalar/reatom-react-ts)

```ts
import { action, atom, createCtx } from "@reatom/core";

// primitive mutable atom
const inputAtom = atom("");
// computed readonly atom
// `spy` reads the atom and subscribes to it
const greetingAtom = atom((ctx) => `Hello, ${ctx.spy(inputAtom)}!`);

// all updates in action processed by a smart batching
const onInput = action((ctx, event) => {
  // update the atom value by call it as a function
  inputAtom(ctx, event.currentTarget.value);
});

// global application context
const ctx = createCtx();

document
  .getElementById("name-input")
  .addEventListener("input", (event) => onInput(ctx, event));

ctx.subscribe(greetingAtom, (greeting) => {
  document.getElementById("greeting").innerText = greeting;
});
```

Check out [@reatom/core docs](/core) for detailed explanation of key principles and features.

## Advanced example

[repl](https://replit.com/@artalar/reatom-react-ts-search-example#src/App.tsx)

We will use [@reatom/core](/core), [@reatom/npm-react](/npm-react), [@reatom/async](/packages/async) and [@reatom/hooks](/packages/hooks) packages in this example by importing it from the meta package [@reatom/framework](/packages/framework).

`reatomAsync` is a simple decorator which wrap your async function and adds extra actions and atoms to track creating promise statuses.

`withDataAtom` adds property `dataAtom` which subscribes to the effect results, it is like a simple cache implementation. `withAbort` allow to define concurrent requests abort strategy, by using `ctx.controller` ([AbortController](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController)) from `reatomAsync`. `withRetry` and `onReject` handler helps to handle temporal rate limit.

Simple `sleep` helper (for debounce) gotten from [utils package](/packages/utils) - it is a built-in microscopic lodash alternative for most popular and tiny helpers.

`onUpdate` is a [hook](/packages/hooks) which subscribes to the atom and call passed callback on every update.

```ts
import {
  atom,
  reatomAsync,
  withAbort,
  withDataAtom,
  withRetry,
  sleep,
  onUpdate,
} from "@reatom/framework";
import { useAtom } from "@reatom/npm-react";
import * as api from "./api";

const searchAtom = atom("", "searchAtom");
const fetchIssues = reatomAsync(async (ctx, query: string) => {
  // debounce
  await sleep(250);
  const { items } = await api.fetchIssues(query, ctx.controller);
  return items;
}, "fetchIssues").pipe(
  withDataAtom([]),
  withAbort({ strategy: "last-in-win" }),
  withRetry({
    onReject(ctx, error: any, retries) {
      return error?.message.includes("rate limit")
        ? 100 * Math.min(500, retries ** 2)
        : -1;
    },
  })
);
onUpdate(searchAtom, fetchIssues);

export default function App() {
  const [search, setSearch] = useAtom(searchAtom);
  const [issues] = useAtom(fetchIssues.dataAtom);
  const [isLoading] = useAtom(
    (ctx) =>
      ctx.spy(fetchIssues.pendingAtom) + ctx.spy(fetchIssues.retriesAtom) > 0
  );

  return (
    <main>
      <input
        value={search}
        onChange={(e) => setSearch(e.currentTarget.value)}
        placeholder="Search"
      />
      {isLoading && "Loading..."}
      <ul>
        {issues.map(({ title }, i) => (
          <li key={i}>{title}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </main>
  );
}
```

The whole logic definition is only about 15 LoC, what is the count would be in a different library? The most impressed thing is that the overhead is only [6KB (gzip)](https://bundlejs.com/?q=%28import%29%40reatom%2Fframework%2C%28import%29%40reatom%2Fnpm-react&treeshake=%5B%7B%0A++atom%2CcreateCtx%2ConUpdate%2CreatomAsync%2Csleep%2CwithAbort%2CwithDataAtom%2CwithRetryAction%2C%7D%5D%2C%5B%7B+useAtom+%7D%5D&share=MYewdgzgLgBBCmBDATsAFgQSiAtjAvDItjgBQBE5ANDOQiulruQJQDcAUKJLAGbxR0ASQgQArvAgEYyJCQwQAnmGClESlTFLAoADxoBHCckUAuOFGQBLMAHMWBAHwwA3hxhEA7oiuwIAG3h4AAdSACYAVgAGdncYbmhXGF94HCkAX2lEb18YfkE0EXFJDGCrUiN4ExodXQA6bksQf0DkWI9ZKDFkMGSoVIhOdJpyfOFRCQhWOrLg%2BFI4z180ABFiRCYyAG0AXRYqReWMACMQZChSFwtkYnhbM1p-dSgAWhsXpbByGHT9w6g0AAlAQmDA6KzgS5xDzgYEAK3gOnM2j0NCqyDO5kQYEUNE61kkDnwjmhHhg6LOAH46jhJBBELZ4HUbMB-GIACaSCg3fowfxWHC%2BVikskwSkwACMUSiMAAVDAALLENA0mykaJRPEgqySOXysIsEVk8wvCUHDy-A6xcAAVWC7NupHoqEwJBoY0KE0JnA48F0wTOsCuwFktwAwqiYGIEJsfmwgA) and you not limited only for network cache, Reatom is enough powerful and expression for describing any kind of states.

<!-- Reatom is a mix of all best from MobX and Redux. It processes immutable data by separated atoms and use single global store, which make dataflow controllable and predictable, but granular and efficient. -->

To get maximum of Reatom and the ecosystem just go to [tutorial](/tutorial). If you need something tiny - check out [the core package docs](https://reatom.dev/core). Also, we have a [package for testing](/packages/testing)!

## FAQ

### Why not X?

**Redux** is awesome and Reatom is heavy inspired by it. Immutability, separation of computations and effects are good architecture designs principles. But there are a lot of missing features, when you trying to build something huge, or want to describe something small. Some of them is just impossible to fix, like [batching](/core#ctxget-batch-api), [O(n) complexity](/guides/atomization#ref-pattern) or that selectors is not inspectable and breaks [the atomicy](/general/what-is-state-manager#state). Others is really [hard to improve](https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect/discussions/491). And boilerplate, yeah, [the difference is a huge](https://github.com/artalar/RTK-entities-basic-example/pull/1/files#diff-43162f68100a9b5eb2e58684c7b9a5dc7b004ba28fd8a4eb6461402ec3a3a6c6).
Reatom solves all this problems and bring much more features by the almost same size.

**MobX** brings too big bundle to use it in a small widgets, Reatom is more universal in this case. Also, MobX has mutability and implicit reactivity, which is usefull for simple cases, but could be not obvious and hard to debug in complex cases. There is no separate thing like action / event / effect to describe some dependent effects sequences (FRP-way). [There is not atomicy too](https://github.com/artalar/state-management-specification/blob/master/src/index.test.js#L60).

**Effector** is too opinionated. There is **no** first-class support for **lazy** reactive computations and all connections are [hot](https://luukgruijs.medium.com/understanding-hot-vs-cold-observables-62d04cf92e03) everytime, which is could be more predictable, but defenetly is not optimal. Effector is not friendly for fabric creation (because of it hotness), which disallow us to use [atomization](/guides/atomization#ref-pattern) patterns, needed to handle immutability efficient. [The bundle size is 2-3 times larger](https://bundlejs.com/?q=effector&treeshake=%5B%7BcraeteStore%2CcreateEvent%2Ccombine%7D%5D) and [performance is lower](https://github.com/artalar/reactive-computed-bench).

[Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand), [nanostores](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores), [xstate](https://xstate.js.org) and [many other](https://gist.github.com/artalar/e5e8a7274dfdfbe9d36c9e5ec22fc650) state managers have no so great combination of type inference, features, bundle size and performance, as Reatom have.

### Why immutability?

Immutable data is much predictable and better for debug, than mutable states and wrapers around that. Reatom specialy designed with focus on [simple debug of async chains](/guides/debug) and [have a patterns](/guides/atomization) to handle [greate performance](#how-performant-reatom-is).

### What LTS policy is used and what about bus factor?

Reatom always developed for long time usage. Our first LTS (Long Time Support) version (v1) [was released in December 2019](https://github.com/artalar/reatom/releases/tag/v1.0) and in 2022 we provided breaking changes less [Migration guid](/core-v1#migration-guide) to the new LTS (v3) version. 3 years of successful maintains is not ended, but continued in [adapter package](/core-v1). We hope it shows and prove our responsibility.

To be honest, right now bus factor is one, [@artalar](https://github.com/artalar/) - the creator and product owner of this, but it wasn't always like this [as you can see](https://github.com/artalar/reatom/graphs/contributors). Reatom PR wasn't great in a past couple of years and a lot of APIs was experimental during development, but now with the new LST version (v3) we bring to new feature of this lib and application development experience for a long time.

### How performant Reatom is?

[Here is the benchmark](https://github.com/artalar/reactive-computed-bench) of complex computations for different state managers. Note that Reatom by default uses immutable data structures, works in a separate context (DI-like) and keeps [atomicity](/general/what-is-state-manager#state), which means the Reatom test checks more features, than other state manager tests. Anyway, for the middle numbers Reatom faster than MobX which is pretty impressive.

Also, check out [atomization guild](/guides/atomization).

### Limitations

Of course there are no software without limitations. Reatom is trying to be a silver bullet but we still have some cases witch you should know about.

- Immutable data always have an additional performance impact and in critical cases you should think well about your structures and how you could handle it better. The good news is that you [don't have to use normalization](/guides/atomization).
- Laziness could be not obvious in some cases and will cause some updates missing. But it easy to debug a missing update, which is more explicit, than memory leaks and performance issues of hot observables. Anyway, we have [hooks](/packages/hooks) for hot linking.
- Currently, there is no way to subscribe on error of any dependency, but we are working on it. However, you could subscribe to ctx logs and check `patch?.error` property.
- Currently, there is no asynchronous transactions support, but we are working on it. It is important feature for simplify building of optimistic UI and we really think it will improve UX a lot.
